# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data(eg., handle categorical variables like salary).
3. Select relevant features and the target variable.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Train the Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
6. Predict the outcomes using the test data.
7. Evaluate the midel's accuracy.
8. Visualize the Decision Tree.

## Program And Output:
```
